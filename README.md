# Python

Through online courses like Coursera's Advanced Data Analytics, I developed proficiency in fundamental Python libraries like pandas, numpy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn. My skills extend from applying Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to building machine learning (ML) models. This was demonstrated in a Google project where I utilized pandas for data wrangling, Scikit-learn for building a [relevant ML model], and Seaborn for data visualization.
